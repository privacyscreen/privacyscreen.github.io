    <p>Following is a description of the method we developed and used to label data for the purposes of training and testing the machine-learning model that serves as the engine for <a href="http://ccpa-env.eba-fmagdcnc.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com">Privacy Screen</a>.</p>
  </div>

<section id="context">
  <div class="container-fluid bg-light text-left">
    <h3 class="margin">Context</h3>
    <p>Inspired by highlighted portion of <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displayText.xhtml?division=3.&part=4.&lawCode=CIV&title=1.81.5.">CA Civ Code § 1798.105(b)</a>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><mark>A business that collects personal information about consumers shall disclose</mark>, pursuant to subparagraph (A) of paragraph (5) of subdivision (a) of Section 1798.130, <mark>the consumer’s rights to request the deletion of the consumer’s personal information.</mark></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Notes, caveats, nuances, etc.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not requiring disclosure of designated methods for submitting requests</li>
      <li>Not requiring policy to use the word "right"</li>
      <li>Definitions of "personal information" vary (e.g., may exclude location data), so this method assumes personal information is collected</li>
      <li>Not attempting to interpret the often ambiguous exceptions listed in many policies (e.g., limitation to countries outside the U.S.)</li>
      <li>Text is not easily extracted from some policies (e.g., some PDFs have no white space between words after copy-pasting from them)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="urls">
  <div class="container-fluid bg-dark text-left">
    <h3 class="margin">Collecting policy URLs</h3>
    <p>To gather a set of URLs for unique privacy policies:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Ensure your browser has malware protection -- website certificates expire, and sites are sometimes compromised by other means.</li>
      <li>Randomly sample a batch of URLs from the <a href="https://www.usableprivacy.org/data">MAPS dataset</a>.</li>
      <li>Remove any duplicate URLs.</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="policies">
  <div class="container-fluid bg-light text-left">
    <h3 class="margin">Collecting policies</h3>
    <p>For each URL:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Assign the URL its own unique identification number.</li>
      <li>If the URL doesn't work at all (e.g., 404 error), try finding the Privacy Policy from the sub-domain's home/index page or via Google.</li>
      <li>Verify the URL is for a privacy policy, which is written in English. Sometimes privacy policies are linked from within other documents like Terms & Conditions.</li>
      <li>See if there's an updated policy elsewhere on the website. Updated policies are more likely to allow requests for deletion (improving balance).</li>
      <li>See if there's a more complete policy elsewhere on the website. Updated policies are more likely to allow requests for deletion (improving balance).</li>
      <li>Record the final URL.</li>
      <li>Ensure that any "See More" fields collapsed by default are expanded.</li>
      <li>Use browser's "inspector" tool to isolate the lowest-level "div" (or "body" if no div) element in HTML that encapsulates all relevant policy text (and hopefully nothing else).
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>Record its CSS selector (i.e., path/location in hierarchy).</li>
          <li>Copy-paste the corresponding policy text into a TXT file dedicated to that URL.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>
</section>

<section id="labeling">
  <div class="container-fluid bg-dark text-left">
    <h3 class="margin">Classifying policies</h3>
    <p>For each privacy policy:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Search sequentially for the following partial synonyms to generate a set of good hits, and then retain the best one:.
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>"delet" (as in delete or deletion)</li>
          <li>"remov" (as in remove or removal)</li>
          <li>"eras" (as in erase or erasure)</li>
          <li>"forg" (as in forget or forgotten).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Note that other synonyms (e.g., "destr" for destroy or destruction) are more commonly associated with other things like malicious deletion of data.</li>
      <li>Note that "change" and its synonyms (e.g., amend, modify, alter) are NOT considered sufficient.</li>
      <li>Verify that deletion isn't limited to:
        <ol type='a'>
          <li>"child" / "kid" / "minors" (also look for under, years, age, etc.)</li>
          <li>"cooke".</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Verify that the user isn't required to delete their own info. For example, user may have limited access -- NOT sufficient if they can only delete contact info. Look for relevant keywords: request, send, ask, inquiry, query, have, obtain, contact, email, write, reach.</li>
      <li>If all of the above are satisfied.
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Mark URL as 1 (otherwise 0)</li>
          <li>Copy-paste only the text relevant to classification into a TXT file dedicated to that URL, capturing all such text between periods (may include section heading, bullets, semicolons, etc.).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
