		<h2 class="introGrab">4 million people die annually due to outdoor air pollution</h2>
        <p class="introDetails">We can push back on polluters with better air quality monitoring. The governent
			often places its sensors away from pollution sources. With the price of sensors falling, community groups
			and residents are starting to buy their own from companies like PurpleAir.com. So far, most sensors wind
			up in wealthier neighborhoods that face less pollution. Our tool aims to change this.
		</p>
		<h2 class="introGrab">FairAir predicts which areas on a map face the most air pollution and recommends the best place
			to put new sensors.</h2>
		<p class="introDetails">
			Optimal placement of sensors ensures: <br>
			* disadvantaged communities have access to air quality data, <br>
			* improves air quality models for everyone,<br>
			* saves money from being wasted on redundant sensors.<br>

                    Community advocates can use FairAir to help make a case to donors that their community needs sensors. The tool can also help
					establish a fair way to place the sensors, focusing them on the areas most likely to be impacted by air pollution.

                    FairAir can help foundations, governments, and others who donate air pollution sensors to identify the communities
					most in need of air quality monitoring. We base our recommendations on where we predict air pollution to be the worst
					and distance from other sensors.

					Live far from a sensor and can't afford one? FairAir offers a free prediction of the air quality in your neighborhood using
					pollution, weather, and topographic data. No model is perfect, and ours is improved when more sensors are placed optimally.

        <h1 class="introTitle">How It Works</h1>
        <p class="modelDetails">
		Policy Screen uses natural language processing and machine learning to assess a privacy policy’s compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The tool focuses on one specific aspect of the CCPA: the user’s right to request deletion of his/her personal information.
		</p>
		<p class="modelDetails">
      Many privacy policies are lengthy, and the specific subsection addressing a user’s right to request deletion makes up a small percentage of the overall text. Policy Screen leverages an inventory of 200+ online privacy policies and uses these inputs to extract the subsection most pertinent to the user’s right to request deletion. This subsection is then fed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model in order to predict whether the extracted text is compliant with the CCPA’s deletion requirements.
		</p>
		<p class="modelDetails">
		The end user is able to view the specific text that was identified as being most pertinent to the user’s right to request deletion, as well as our model’s predicted compliance.
